# A C++ basic generic Makefile with multiple sources and headers (Linux & MAC OSX compatible)

Make sure you have lcurl installed (for linux users)

If not :

    sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev


You just have to modify variables SRC, INC, EXEC and MAIN with your environment settings.

And sudo make in your terminal to generate the exec.
